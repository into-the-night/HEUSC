## HEUSC

HEUSC is a voice assistant that uses OpenAI's Whisper for audio transcription, pyaudio for audio recording and selenium for webscraping and browsing.

Always wanted to make a voice assistant project. Initial days with this, just does some basic google search and playing youtube. There are some problems with selenium that I am trying to figure out, will fix soon.
